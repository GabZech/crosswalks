# About

This repo  includes crosswalks and mappings between labour market-related taxonomies and databases that I've created in the context of my work at the Bertelsmann Stiftung:

* [Crosswalk between the 122 ERA Tarifbeispiele and the KldB occupations](Tarifbeispiele-to-KldB/): a mapping using string comparison methods in the Jellyfish python library.
